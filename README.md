Accordion Menu Without JQuery
==========================

I wanted to try creating a dropdown menu with a nice sliding animation without having to use JQuery, so I came up with this.

It works well. No JQuery required. Although I did use a JQuery style "DomReady" piece of code as it just felt better than using "window.onload".
